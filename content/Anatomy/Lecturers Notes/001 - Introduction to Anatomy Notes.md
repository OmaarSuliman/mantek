**Anatomy**  : the science used to deal with the study of the structure, arrangement and geography of the human body, and it is the base for many other fields of medical science.

## A Brief history of Anatomy

from 300 BCE up to the second century scientist, Doctors, and artist used to experiment and practice on cadavers which were positioned flat on their back to  make it easier for themselves to draw and reference from that position.
## Methods used in the study of Anatomy

![[methods of studying anatomy.png]]

### Gross Anatomy

The study of anatomy by dissecting cadavers with only the naked eyes.
### Living Anatomy

The study of anatomy of living organisms by palpation, using hand, inspection using eye & auscultation using stethoscope or endoscopy.
### Surface Anatomy (Topographic anatomy)

The study of deeper parts of the body in relation to the surface of the skin which is helpful in clinical practice and surgical operations.
### Radiographic and imaging Anatomy

The study of bones and deep organs by plain radiography, contrast ultrasound and computed tomography (CT).
### Cross sectional Anatomy

The study of how different parts of the body are structured and arranged, especially when looking at cross-sections or slices, is essential for techniques like CT scans and MRIs. This field helps us see and understand the body’s inner workings in a clear and detailed way.
### Applied Anatomy

The study that focuses on using anatomical knowledge in medical and surgical practices. It bridges the gap between theory and real-life application, helping healthcare professionals understand how the body's structures function in health and disease. This practical knowledge is essential for making accurate diagnoses, performing surgeries, and providing effective patient care.
### Surgical Anatomy

The anatomy of surgical exposure and incision involves understanding how to access the body’s internal structures safely and effectively during a procedure. This includes knowing the layers of skin, muscle, and other tissues that need to be navigated.

## Anatomical terms

### Position terms
#### Anatomical position

The anatomical position is a standardized way to observe or image the body, providing a clear reference for anatomical descriptions. In this position:

- The subject stands upright.
- The body is erect.
- The eyes are directed forward.
- The arms are straight and held at the sides.
- The palms face forward.
- The feet are adducted.
#### supine position

The supine position refers to lying on the back with the face looking upward. This position is commonly used in medical examinations and procedures for easy access to the front of the body.
#### prone position

When the body lies down with the face looking downward, it is called the prone position. This position is often used in medical examinations and certain treatments, providing access to the back of the body.

### Plane terms

#### The median plane

also known as the midsagittal plane, is a vertical plane that runs from front to back. It divides the body into two equal halves: right and left. This plane aligns with the sagittal suture of the skull. It serves as an important reference in anatomical studies and medical imaging.
#### The paramedian sagittal plane

refers to any vertical plane that runs parallel to the median plane. Unlike the median plane, which divides the body into equal right and left halves, paramedian planes create unequal sections. These planes are useful in anatomical and medical contexts for examining structures that are slightly off-center.
#### The coronal plane

also known as the frontal plane, is a vertical plane that runs side to side, dividing the body into anterior (front) and posterior (back) parts. It is oriented at right angles to the median sagittal plane and aligns with the coronal suture of the skull. This plane is essential for understanding the front and back aspects of the body in both anatomy and medical imaging.
#### The axial plane

also known as the The transverse plane, also known as the axial plane, is a horizontal plane that divides the body into superior (upper) and inferior (lower) parts. It is oriented at right angles to vertical planes, playing a key role in cross-sectional imaging like CT scans and MRIs.

| Flexion       | Bending a joint to decrease the angle between body parts                              |
| Extension     | Straightening a joint to increase the angle between body parts                        |
| Abduction     | Moving a limb away from the midline of the body                                       |
| Adduction     | Moving a limb toward the midline of the body                                          |
| Rotation      | Turning a body part around its own axis                                               |
| Circumduction | Circular movement of a limb that outlines a cone                                      |
