## Arrangement of Structures in the Body

1. **Bones**: Provide the supporting framework.
2. **Muscles**: Attach to bones for movement.
3. **Neurovascular Bundles**: Comprise blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatics located between muscles.
4. **Cavities**: 
   - **Thoracic Cavity**: Houses organs like the heart and lungs.
   - **Abdominal Cavity**: Contains organs such as the stomach and intestines.
5. **Coverings**: Include:
   - **Skin**
   - **Superficial Fascia**
   - **Deep Fascia**
## Overview of Bones

- The term **"skeleton"** is derived from the Greek word meaning "dried up."
- Bones are hard yet are living tissues with high vascularity and ongoing calcium turnover.
## Functions of the Skeletal System

1. **Support**: Acts as an internal framework.
2. **Protection**: Safeguards soft organs.
3. **Movement**: Provides muscle attachment points.
4. **Storage**: Stores minerals, primarily calcium and phosphorus.
5. **Blood Cell Formation**: Plays a role in hematopoiesis.
## Bone Classification

- **Regional Classification**
- **Morphological Classification**
- **Structural Classification**
- **Developmental Classification**
## Adult Human Skeleton

- Composed of **206 named bones**:
  - **Axial Skeleton**: Includes the skull, vertebral column, and thoracic cage.
  - **Appendicular Skeleton**: Consists of the upper/lower extremities and girdles.
## Macroscopic Bone Architecture

- **Compact Bone**: Dense, hard structure that resists bending.
- **Cancellous (Spongy) Bone**: Found in the epiphyses of long bones, characterized by a trabecular meshwork.
## Bone Development (Ossification)

1. **Membranous Bone**: Develops directly from mesenchymal tissue (e.g., skull vault).
2. **Cartilaginous Bone**: Forms by replacing hyaline cartilage (e.g., long bones).
3. **Mixed Ossification Bones**: Composed of both membranous and cartilaginous origins (e.g., mandible).
## Types of Bones

1. **Long Bones**: Have an elongated shaft (diaphysis) with two ends (epiphyses).
2. **Short Bones**: Cuboidal shape (e.g., tarsal bones).
3. **Flat Bones**: Shallow plates (e.g., skull vault).
4. **Irregular Bones**: Complex shapes (e.g., vertebrae).
5. **Pneumatic Bones**: Contain air spaces (e.g., maxilla).
6. **Sesamoid Bones**: Embedded in tendons (e.g., patella).
7. **Accessory Bones**: Extra bones that may be seen on X-rays.
## Long Bone Structure

- **Epiphysis**: Ends of the long bone.
- **Diaphysis**: Shaft of the long bone.
- **Metaphysis**: Growth zone between epiphysis and diaphysis.
## Medullary Cavity

- Contains red or yellow bone marrow; red marrow is active in blood formation during infancy.
## Arterial Supply to Bones

1. **Nutrient Artery**: Enters through the nutrient foramen; supplies the medullary cavity and inner cortex.
2. **Periosteal Arteries**: Supply the outer cortex.
3. **Metaphyseal Arteries**: Supply the metaphysis; anastomose with nutrient artery.
4. **Epiphyseal Arteries**: Supply the epiphysis through multiple foramina.
## Cartilage Overview

- A firm, rubber-like component of the skeleton that is non-vascular and insensitive, covered by perichondrium.
### Types of Cartilage

1. **Hyaline Cartilage**: Bluish-white, translucent; found in joints, costal cartilages, and respiratory structures.
2. **White Fibrocartilage** : Rich in collagen fibers; found in intervertebral discs.
3. **Yellow Elastic Cartilage**: More flexible due to elastic fibers; located in the external ear and epiglottis.
