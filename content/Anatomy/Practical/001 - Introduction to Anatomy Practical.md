### Supplementary Video

Welcome to our Introduction to Anatomy Practical! In this session, we will explore the foundational aspects of human anatomy, focusing on key systems and structures that form the basis of our understanding of the body.

Unfortunately, we were unable to locate a video resource to enhance our learning experience. This could be due to various reasons, such as technical difficulties or limited access to specific educational materials. We understand that visual aids can significantly enrich our understanding, and we appreciate your patience as we navigate this challenge.

Despite the absence of a video, we encourage active participation in discussions and hands-on activities. Engaging with anatomical models and diagrams will provide valuable insights into the complex organization of the body.

We look forward to a productive session where we can deepen our knowledge of anatomy together. Let's make the most of our time and resources!
